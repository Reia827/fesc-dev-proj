<div class="content">
  <img src="images/periana-resized.png" alt="Roy Periana">
    
<p>Prof. Periana immigrated to the US when he was 17 years old to pursue a career as a Chemist. Working his way through college as a busboy he graduated with honors from the University of Michigan with a BSc in Chemistry. He then joined Dow Chemical where he worked for two years. During this time his work resulted in 10 patent applications. He then left Dow Chemical to pursue a PhD in chemistry at U.C. Berkeley. At Berkeley he helped to pioneer the emerging field of low-temperature hydrocarbon chemistry and graduated summa cum laude after four years. With 15 offers in hand, Dr. Periana chose to move to the Monsanto Chemical Co. in St. Louis, MO. Quickly, realizing that he was not a large company man, he left for a position with an early startup company in the Silicon Valley, Catalytica, Inc. At Catalytica he rose through the ranks from Research Chemist to Vice President of research over the course of 10 years. In that time he was directly responsible for raising approximately $35 million. His work helped to take the company public with a $250MM capitalization. During this time he became one of the world’s leading experts in the now established field of low-temperature chemistry for the conversion of hydrocarbons raw materials to fuels, chemicals, and power. His work there was highlighted by numerous invitations to the leading universities and research institutes of the world, interviews on National Public Radio, coverage by Wall Street, science shows on TV as well as two publications in Science, one of the two most prestigious scientific journals in the world. He is the key inventor on the only systems that the world has developed for the efficient, lost cost, low temperature conversion of methane to methanol. Coupled with changing management at Catalytica and the dot com meltdown, Dr. Periana chose to accept a position as Chemistry Professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in order to continue his work on the development of the next generation of catalysts for the 21st Century. Here Prof. Periana was tenured and became an acknowledged leader in the field of low-temperature catalysis. His work here is highlighted by substantial funding from oil companies, as well as, the NSF and publication in Science and other leading journals. He taught and graduated 6 graduate students during this time. At this point he was discovered by Dr. Lerner, the president of Scripps and offered a position as a full Chemistry Professor. Prof. Periana chose to move to Scripps Florida as he saw this as the next hot bed for technology development. Already Prof. Periana has raised almost $1MM, with the promise for almost $7MM more in the next three to five years. His long-term plans at Scripps Florida will be to build a $100MM department focused on the development of the next generation of cleaner, cheaper fuels, chemicals, and energy for the 21st century.</p>
