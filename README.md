### GOOGLE CHARTS

#### I added total consumption data into a line chart and the energy production data in a bar chart. I used the Google CDN code for the charts and registered for a personal API key to access the data for the charts.
#### The line chart demonstrates annual total electricity consumption in Florida between 1960 and 2016. 
#### The bar chart demonstrates annual renewable energy production in Florida between 1960 and 2016.

#### I researched examples online for code and to learn how to implement Google charts and APIs into the site. I watched class 8 video for a tutorial on APIs.
#### I read documentation for EIA and Google to assist me in the proess.
#### I researched how other sites display energy usage in charts to determine which type would work best with the data.

### API DOCUMENTATION

#### Data for Google Charts on data.html is sourced from the open data available on the U.S. EIA at the following:

###### Renewable Energy Production, Florida: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?sdid=SEDS.REPRB.FL.A
###### Electricity Total Consumption in Florida: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?sdid=SEDS.ESTCB.FL.A
